"""A real, minimal prompt-injection probe against a naive local target

signature capability implemented at this scaffold's depth).

Contents:

- :data:`DEFAULT_SECRET` / :func:`naive_vulnerable_target` -- a
  deliberately naive, deliberately vulnerable stand-in for a local model
  target. It is a plain module-level Python function (not a network call,
  not a real model) that echoes back a canned "system prompt" -- including
  a fake secret it was told to protect -- whenever the user's input looks
  like a repeat/echo/override instruction. This is the classic
  prompt-injection failure mode (OWASP LLM01): a system prompt containing
  sensitive material, with no semantic enforcement of "never reveal it."
- :func:`build_probe_sandbox_policy` -- LazyRed's mode-specific
  :class:`~lazycore.sandbox.SandboxPolicy` values layered on top of the
  shared executor (§2.3): no filesystem writes, no network, a short
  timeout. LazyRed does not define its own executor class -- only its own
  policy values, per the module dependency rule in CLAUDE.md.
- :func:`detect_secret_leak` -- the detector: a simple substring/regex
  check for whether ``DEFAULT_SECRET`` leaked into the target's output.
- :class:`PromptInjectionAdapter` -- the one concrete
  :class:`~benchcraft_lazyred.adapter.BaseSecurityAdapter` implementation
  in this package, wiring the above together and invoking the target via
  ``lazycore.sandbox``'s ``run_callable`` (real subprocess sandboxing on
  macOS via :class:`~lazycore.sandbox.SeatbeltSandboxExecutor` -- not
  decorative), plus emitting one OTel span per attempt via
  :mod:`lazycore.telemetry`.

    """A deliberately naive, deliberately vulnerable stand-in for a local model.

    Per the task's split-trust framing (§2.3.1): a *real* local model's
    GPU-bound inference would run unsandboxed, and only its CPU-bound
    tool-calling/orchestration layer would be sandboxed. This scaffold has
    no real model at all -- ``naive_vulnerable_target`` stands in for the
    whole "generation" step, and invoking it is treated as the CPU-bound
    orchestration step worth demonstrating the sandbox wiring on (per the
    task spec), not a real GPU inference call.

    Behavior: builds a canned "system prompt" that names ``secret`` and
    instructs (in prose only -- there is no actual enforcement mechanism)
    that it must never be revealed. If ``user_input`` contains any of
    :data:`PROMPT_INJECTION_TRIGGERS` (case-insensitive substring match),
    the function complies and echoes the entire system prompt -- secret
    included -- back to the caller. Otherwise it gives an innocuous reply
    that never mentions the secret. This unconditional compliance with an
    embedded "repeat/reveal" instruction is the textbook OWASP LLM01
    prompt-injection failure mode.

    Must remain a plain, module-level, picklable function (no closures) --
    :class:`PromptInjectionAdapter` invokes it via ``functools.partial``
    through the shared sandbox executor's ``run_callable``, which requires
    a picklable callable to marshal it into a subprocess.
