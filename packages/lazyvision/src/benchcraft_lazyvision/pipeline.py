"""``SimpleImagePipeline``: the first concrete Tier-3 ``DenseMediaPipeline``.

Per the architecture doc §2.1 (Tier 3: dense image/audio) and
`lazycore.data.DenseMediaPipeline`'s own docstring: LazyCore defines only
the *shape* of the decode -> augment -> to-dense-tensor pipeline and
explicitly depends on nothing image/tensor-related; LazyVision is expected
to provide the first concrete decode/augment implementation. This module is
that implementation -- it subclasses `lazycore.data.DenseMediaPipeline`
directly rather than redefining a parallel interface, per CLAUDE.md's
"fix what's there, don't duplicate" rule.

Scope for this pass is deliberately narrow (a "signature capability" slice,
not the full Tier-3 pipeline the architecture doc envisions):

- ``decode`` uses Pillow to turn raw encoded image bytes (PNG/JPEG/...)
  into a PIL ``Image`` -- not the eventual Rust/PyO3 native decoder
  described in the architecture doc (explicitly deferred; see README).
- ``augment`` applies one real, simple augmentation (a seeded random
  horizontal flip) plus a deterministic resize -- not the full FFCV-style
  augmentation surface, SAM/LLRD training-time regularization, or
  hybrid-local-convolutional spatial-locality modules described elsewhere
  in the architecture doc (all deferred).
- ``to_dense_tensor`` converts to a `torch.Tensor` in ``(C, H, W)`` layout,
  float32, normalized to ``[0, 1]``. PyTorch tensors implement
  ``__dlpack__``/``__dlpack_device__`` natively, so this return value
  already satisfies `lazycore.data`'s ``_SupportsDLPack`` protocol without
  this module needing to do anything special -- the DLPack handoff the
  architecture doc describes ("zero-copy handoff only at the final
  dense-tensor stage") is simply "return a torch.Tensor" here.
