"""A small CNN image classifier (architecture doc Part 3, "Module 5: LazyVision").

Scope for this scaffold-depth pass is deliberately narrow: a tiny,
LeNet-style CNN (a few conv layers, one linear head), used purely to prove
the `torch.export` -> ONNX export path in :mod:`benchcraft_lazyvision.export`
works end-to-end and correctly. Training a real model on real data is
explicitly **not** required at this scope -- the point is validating the
export mechanism, not model accuracy -- so :func:`build_model` returns an
initialized-but-untrained model. Vision Transformers, real-time object
detectors (YOLO/D-FINE/RT-DETR), and acoustic/spectrogram models from the
same architecture-doc section are out of scope for this pass; see the
package README's "Deferred" section.

Per CLAUDE.md's MPS-primary constraint: nothing here hardcodes
``device="cpu"`` in a way that would prevent later running on MPS --
:func:`build_model` accepts an arbitrary ``torch.device``/device string and
the model itself is plain `nn.Module` layers with no CUDA-only or
CPU-only assumptions.

**Device resolution.** :func:`resolve_device` is the one canonical
device-selection helper in this package (mirroring
`benchcraft_lazygraph.gcn.resolve_device`'s exact MPS -> CUDA -> CPU
auto-detect-with-fallback pattern, per CLAUDE.md's "one canonical location
per capability" rule and its own "MPS is the primary backend" constraint).
:func:`build_model`, :func:`synthetic_classification_batch`, and
`benchcraft_lazyvision.pipeline.SimpleImagePipeline` all default their
``device`` to ``None``, which routes through this same helper -- so a
caller who does not specify a device gets MPS-first-with-CPU-fallback,
not a hardcoded CPU default. This module's own *tests* and the *example
script* still explicitly pin ``device="cpu"`` for hermetic, portable,
deterministic automated verification -- not because MPS is unsupported,
but because CPU-for-tests was an intentional prior design choice (see the
package README's "MPS note") that this change preserves rather than
overrides.
