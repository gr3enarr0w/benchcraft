"""dscraft.forecast -- LazyForecast scaffold: classical statistical forecasting.

Public API surface for the classical-statistical-forecasting branch of
LazyForecast (architecture doc Part 3, "Module 3: LazyForecast"): fit any
of Nixtla's ``statsforecast`` classical models (see ``SUPPORTED_MODELS`` --
autoregressive/exponential-smoothing autofits, simple baselines, and the
Croston intermittent-demand family) over a Tier-1 Arrow-backed pandas or
Polars input, produce a horizon forecast, and score it with a basic
backtest/evaluation report (per-series and averaged MAE/RMSE).

Everything else described for LazyForecast in the architecture doc -- the
tree-based ML branch (MLForecast/LightGBM/XGBoost), the zero-shot Time
Series Foundation Models (TimesFM/Chronos-Bolt/Lag-Llama/PatchTST), the
self-healing preprocessing engine, and conformal-prediction uncertainty
quantification (MSCP/EnbPI) -- is explicitly out of scope for this pass.
See the package README for the full rationale.
