# dscraft

A unified, MIT-licensed, local-first ML tooling platform: tabular AutoML,
data cleaning, time-series forecasting, graph ML, computer vision, LLM
fine-tuning, LLM/agent red-teaming, and agent/RAG benchmark eval, all
installed and imported as one real Python package — the way numpy or
PyTorch ships one distribution with an internal module tree, not nine
separately-installed packages.

```bash
pip install dscraft                  # base install: just dscraft.core
pip install "dscraft[automl]"        # + dscraft.automl's runtime deps
pip install "dscraft[all]"           # every subpackage's runtime deps
```

```python
import dscraft.core        # always available
import dscraft.automl      # available once installed with the `automl` extra
```

Each subpackage below is a **scaffold-depth pass**: a real, working slice
of its eventual scope (per `DSCraft_Unified_Architecture.md`), not a full
implementation. See that document for the full architecture, locked
design decisions, and per-module roadmap; this README only orients you to
what's here today and how to install/run it.

## Subpackages

| Subpackage | Extra | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [`dscraft.core`](#dscraftcore) | *(base install)* | Shared substrate: three-tier data conventions, OTel GenAI telemetry helpers, license-isolation policy, shared sandbox executor. |
| [`dscraft.automl`](#dscraftautoml) | `automl` (+ `automl-onnx`) | Clean-room tabular AutoML — `.compile()` fuses a fitted `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` into one portable ONNX graph via `skl2onnx`. |
| [`dscraft.clean`](#dscraftclean) | `clean` | Data-quality firewall — ONNX Runtime (PyTorch-free) text embeddings feeding cosine-similarity near-duplicate detection. |
| [`dscraft.forecast`](#dscraftforecast) | `forecast` | Classical statistical forecasting (AutoARIMA/AutoETS via Nixtla `statsforecast`) over a Tier-1 Arrow-backed pipeline, plus a basic backtest report. |
| [`dscraft.graph`](#dscraftgraph) | `graph` | Sparse graph ML — a concrete Tier-2 COO↔CSR/CSC tensor adapter (PyG↔SciPy) plus a minimal GCN forward pass. |
| [`dscraft.vision`](#dscraftvision) | `vision` | Computer vision — a concrete Tier-3 dense image pipeline (decode→augment→tensor) plus a small CNN exported via `torch.export()`→ONNX. |
| [`dscraft.tune`](#dscrafttune) | `tune` | Local LLM fine-tuning — an Adapter-Factory `BaseTrainingAdapter` interface with a `ProgrammaticAdapter` doing real (tiny) LoRA fine-tuning via `peft`/`transformers`. |
| [`dscraft.security`](#dscraftsecurity) | `security` | LLM red-teaming — a `BaseSecurityAdapter` running a real prompt-injection probe/detector loop against a local target inside the shared sandbox, OWASP-mapped findings. |
| [`dscraft.agent`](#dscraftagent) | `agent` | Agent/benchmark eval — a bring-your-own-agent `AgentAdapter` executing file-manipulation tool-use tasks inside the shared sandbox, scored for pass rate and latency. |

## Installation

```bash
# Base install — just dscraft.core (opentelemetry-api only)
pip install dscraft

# One subpackage's runtime deps
pip install "dscraft[forecast]"

# AutoML's optional ONNX export path (on top of the `automl` extra)
pip install "dscraft[automl,automl-onnx]"

# Everything (all nine subpackages' runtime deps)
pip install "dscraft[all]"
```

### Local development

```bash
cd /path/to/this/repo
pip install -e "packages/dscraft[dev,all]"
pytest packages/dscraft/tests
```

`dev` adds `pytest` plus test-only dependencies (`pandas`, `polars`,
`pyarrow`, `statsmodels`) that some subpackages' test suites need but
their runtime code does not. `dev` is deliberately kept free of any
"heavy" dependency (torch, onnx, transformers, scikit-learn) so that
`pip install -e "packages/dscraft[dev]"` alone stays minimal — those only
come in via a subpackage's own extra (e.g. `automl`, `vision`) or via
`all`. Installing `all` alongside `dev` is what lets the *entire* combined
test suite (all nine subpackages) run in one environment.

To run a single subpackage's tests in isolation, install just its extra:

```bash
pip install -e "packages/dscraft[forecast,dev]"
pytest packages/dscraft/tests/forecast
```

`dscraft.vision`'s test suite is the one exception: its real-dataset
validation test uses `sklearn.datasets.load_digits()` (test-only, not a
`vision` runtime dependency), so running it in isolation needs
`scikit-learn` from somewhere — either add the `automl` extra
(`dscraft[vision,automl,dev]`, since `automl` already depends on
`scikit-learn`) or install `scikit-learn` directly alongside
`dscraft[vision,dev]`. The full combined install (`dscraft[all,dev]`)
always has it, via `automl`.

## `dscraft.core`

The thin, shared substrate underneath every other subpackage: three-tier
data/tensor conventions (Tier 1 Arrow-backed pandas/Polars, Tier 2 sparse
graph tensor adapters, Tier 3 dense media pipelines), OpenTelemetry
GenAI-schema telemetry helpers, the license-isolation policy table and
model-tier allowlist mechanism, and the shared sandbox executor
(`SandboxPolicy` + `BaseSandboxExecutor`, with a real `SeatbeltSandboxExecutor`
on macOS) used by both `dscraft.security` and `dscraft.agent`. Its only
runtime dependency is `opentelemetry-api`; it never depends on pandas,
polars, torch, or any ML framework. Always installed — no extra needed.

## `dscraft.automl`

`dscraft.automl.compile()` takes a **fitted** `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`
and returns a single, portable `onnx.ModelProto` via `skl2onnx`, fusing
every pipeline step into one graph loadable by `onnxruntime` with no
scikit-learn install required at serving time. Base runtime deps
(`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`) install via the `automl` extra;
`skl2onnx`/`onnx`/`onnxruntime` (needed only for `.compile()` itself, and
lazily imported) install via the separate `automl-onnx` extra.

## `dscraft.clean`

ONNX Runtime (deliberately PyTorch-free, to stay lightweight) text
embeddings feeding cosine-similarity near-duplicate detection — a
scaffold of the LazyClean module's D4 semantic-dedup idea. Zero-vector
("no extractable features") rows are honestly reported as "not
comparable," distinct from both confirmed-duplicate and confirmed-distinct
pairs. Install via the `clean` extra.

## `dscraft.forecast`

Classical statistical forecasting (AutoARIMA/AutoETS via Nixtla's
`statsforecast`) over a Tier-1 Arrow-backed input pipeline, with a basic
train/test backtest reporting MAE/RMSE. The tree-based ML branch, TSFM
zero-shot branch, self-healing preprocessing, and conformal-prediction
leaderboard from the full LazyForecast design are deferred. Install via
the `forecast` extra.

## `dscraft.graph`

`PyGSparseAdapter` is the first concrete implementation of
`dscraft.core.data.SparseGraphTensorAdapter`: a real COO↔CSR/CSC bridge
between PyTorch Geometric edge-index tensors and `scipy.sparse`, since
DLPack cannot represent sparsity. `GCN` is a minimal two-layer graph
convolutional network built on `torch_geometric.nn.GCNConv` that consumes
the adapter directly. Install via the `graph` extra.

## `dscraft.vision`

`SimpleImagePipeline` is the first concrete implementation of
`dscraft.core.data.DenseMediaPipeline` (decode via Pillow → augment
resize/flip → dense `torch.Tensor`, DLPack-ready). `TinyCNN` is a small
LeNet-style classifier captured via `torch.export()` and exported to ONNX,
proving the export path end-to-end. Install via the `vision` extra.

## `dscraft.tune`

`BaseTrainingAdapter` is a minimal Adapter-Factory interface
(`prepare`/`train_step`/`save_adapter`); `ProgrammaticAdapter` is the one
concrete implementation, running a real (tiny) LoRA fine-tuning step on a
small local causal LM via `peft` + `transformers` — genuine forward +
backward + optimizer-step training, not a mock. Subprocess-isolated
adapters (torchtune/Axolotl), multi-fidelity BOHB tuning, and real
GGUF/MLX export are deferred. Install via the `tune` extra.

## `dscraft.security`

A minimal, real, end-to-end slice of the LazyRed module: `BaseSecurityAdapter`
runs one probe (`PromptInjectionAdapter`) against a deliberately vulnerable
local target function, executed through the shared `dscraft.core.sandbox`
executor, with findings mapped to the OWASP LLM Top 10 and reported via
`dscraft.core.telemetry`. No extra heavy runtime deps beyond `dscraft.core`
itself — install via the `security` extra.

## `dscraft.agent`

A minimal, real bring-your-own-agent benchmark loop: `SandboxedAgentAdapter`
always executes an agent's chosen action through a caller-supplied
`dscraft.core.sandbox.BaseSandboxExecutor`; a small file-manipulation task
family (pass-designed and sandbox-escape-attempt variants) proves the
sandbox genuinely drives the scored outcome; a tiny benchmark runner
reports aggregate pass rate and latency via `dscraft.core.telemetry`. No
extra heavy runtime deps beyond `dscraft.core` itself — install via the
`agent` extra.

locked v1 architecture — module scope, algorithms, licensing policy, and
what's deferred to later phases. Each subpackage's own docstrings and
`packages/dscraft/tests/<subpackage>/` cover implementation-level detail
this README intentionally omits.
