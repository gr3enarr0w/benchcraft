"""A tiny multi-task benchmark runner (architecture doc Part 3, "Module 8: LazyAgent").

This is a deliberately minimal stand-in for the full "leaderboard" style
Multi-Objective Pareto RAG Optimization loop (accuracy vs. latency vs.
cost) described in Part 3 -- that loop, along with DISCO-style sample
condensation, is explicitly out of scope for this pass (see README). What
*is* implemented here: run a small, fixed set of :class:`TaskSpec` variants
through a :class:`~benchcraft_lazyagent.adapter.SandboxedAgentAdapter`,
score each one, and aggregate a pass rate + mean wall-clock latency --
enough to prove the sandboxed benchmark-eval loop end-to-end.

Reports each run via `lazycore.telemetry`'s OTel GenAI helpers
(`genai_span`, `set_ml_metric`, `add_transcript_event`) rather than a
parallel telemetry/reporting schema, per architecture doc §2.6.

    Latency is measured via ``time.perf_counter()`` around the adapter's
    ``run_task`` call only (the actual agent-decide + sandboxed-execute
    work), not around scoring/telemetry overhead.

    This is the **one** per-task exception boundary for the whole benchmark
    loop (`run_benchmark` deliberately does not add a second one around its
    call to this function -- see that function's docstring). Any exception
    raised by ``agent_fn`` (invoked indirectly via ``adapter.run_task``),
    by ``adapter.run_task`` itself (e.g. a sandbox executor raising
    `lazycore.sandbox.SandboxPolicyViolationError` for fail-fast policy
    violations, or `lazycore.sandbox.SandboxBackendUnavailableError`), or
    by ``scorer`` is caught here and converted into a failed
    :class:`TaskResult` rather than propagating out and aborting every
    other task in the suite. ``KeyboardInterrupt``/``SystemExit`` are
    intentionally *not* caught (``except Exception``, not
    ``except BaseException``) -- a user's Ctrl-C or an explicit process
    exit should still stop the run.

    On such a failure, ``latency_seconds`` records wall-clock time up to
    the point of failure (not ``NaN``/``0``) so `run_benchmark`'s mean-
    latency aggregation stays a meaningful number rather than needing
    special-casing, and ``trajectory`` is ``None`` if the failure happened
    before ``adapter.run_task`` returned one (e.g. ``agent_fn`` itself
    raised), or the real trajectory if only ``scorer`` raised afterwards.
