"""The one concrete benchmark task family: file-manipulation tool-use.

Per README "Scope", this pass implements exactly one task family -- create
a file with expected content in a sandboxed working directory -- rather
than a general task-description schema or a SWE-bench-style suite. Two
task variants are provided:

- :func:`make_pass_task` -- the agent's write target is inside the
  sandbox's ``allowed_write_paths``. The rule-based reference agent
  (:func:`rule_based_agent`) issues a shell command to create the file, the
  shared `lazycore.sandbox` executor allows it, and the task scores as a
  success.
- :func:`make_fail_task` -- the agent (deliberately, to exercise
  containment) attempts to write *outside* ``allowed_write_paths``. The
  shared sandbox executor's default-deny write policy blocks this, the
  file is never created, and the task scores as a failure -- proving the
  sandbox's containment genuinely drives the scored outcome, not just
  decoration around it.

:func:`rule_based_agent` is the one reference "agent" callable this package
ships: a plain, deterministic Python function (not an LLM, not a real
framework) that reads a :class:`~benchcraft_lazyagent.adapter.FileTaskSpec`
and decides on a shell command satisfying (or, for the fail variant,
attempting to satisfy) the task description. Its signature matches
:data:`~benchcraft_lazyagent.adapter.AgentFn` exactly, so a caller could
swap in a real framework's decision function without changing
`benchcraft_lazyagent.adapter` or `benchcraft_lazyagent.benchmark` at all.
