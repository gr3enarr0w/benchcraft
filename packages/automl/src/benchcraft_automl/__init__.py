"""benchcraft-automl: Benchcraft's clean-room tabular AutoML module.

This scaffold-depth pass implements exactly one signature capability from
the architecture doc (Part 3, "Module 1: AutoML"): the `.compile()` path
that fuses a fitted `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` into a single ONNX graph
via `skl2onnx`, replacing brittle pickle-based serialization. See
`compile.py` and the package README for details and clean-room provenance.

The streaming/incremental `partial_fit` fading-factor evaluator and the
PSI drift-detection feature from the same architecture doc section are
explicitly out of scope for this pass -- future work, not implemented
here.

Public API surface (this is the one canonical entrypoint -- no parallel
export path exists elsewhere in this package):
