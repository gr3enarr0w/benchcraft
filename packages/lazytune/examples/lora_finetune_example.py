"""Runnable demo: real (tiny) LoRA fine-tuning via the ProgrammaticAdapter.

This script only imports and calls the real `benchcraft_lazytune` package
API -- it does not reimplement any model-building or training logic inline
(per CLAUDE.md's "no net-new scripts" rule). Run it with:

    python packages/lazytune/examples/lora_finetune_example.py

It uses the fully hermetic from-scratch model
(`build_hermetic_causal_lm`, wired in automatically by
`ProgrammaticAdapter.prepare(None, dataset)`), so no network access or
bundled checkpoint file is required. See the package README for how a real
production base model (`openai-community/gpt2`, registered in
`MODEL_ALLOWLIST`) would be wired in via the same `ProgrammaticAdapter` API.
