"""Regression tests for the three confirmed security-review findings on
`lazycore.sandbox` (macOS Seatbelt backend + shared SandboxPolicy):

1. `policy_blocked` conflating Seatbelt denial with generic Unix
   permission errors.
2. Symlinked `allowed_write_paths`/`allowed_read_paths` entries silently
   widening the granted policy via `Path.resolve()`.
3. Relative paths in `SandboxPolicy` resolving against call-time CWD
   rather than construction-time CWD, despite `frozen=True`.

Tests for (2) and (3) are pure Python (no `sandbox-exec` invocation) and
run on any platform. Test for (1) actually invokes `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec`
(to prove the *default* Seatbelt-unrestricted-read profile is really in
effect) and is skipped on non-macOS hosts, matching this package's existing
convention in `test_seatbelt.py`.
