"""Shared sandbox executor interface (architecture doc §2.3, §2.3.1).

This module defines the *shared* abstraction both LazyRed and LazyAgent
build mode-specific policies on top of. Per §2.3, the two modules contain
the same kernel-level threat class -- arbitrary code execution by an agent
or red-team target -- so LazyCore provides one executor interface and one
generic policy dataclass, not two parallel implementations. Mode-specific
*policy values* (what a "LazyRed target sandbox" or a "LazyAgent benchmark
task sandbox" actually allows) are each module's job when it is built;
this module only defines the generic shape those policies share.

**The GPU/split-trust boundary (§2.3.1) is load-bearing here.** Research
found that no Mac container/VM boundary exposes Metal/MPS passthrough, and
that Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`) *cannot* mediate GPU/Metal/Cocoa access even
in principle -- "GPU and display passthrough flags have no effect on macOS
because Metal and Cocoa are system-level and cannot be blocked via SBPL."
The locked v1 recommendation is therefore a **split-trust architecture**:
GPU-bound model inference always runs unsandboxed (there is no adversarial
surface there -- it's local weights and forward-pass compute), and only the
CPU-bound tool-calling/code-execution layer is sandboxed. Every executor in
this package -- including this base class -- exists to constrain *that*
layer only. Do not add, or ask an implementation to add, any logic that
attempts to gate GPU/Metal/Cocoa access; per §2.3.1 this is both technically
impossible via Seatbelt and out of scope by design.

class SandboxPolicy:
    """Generic, mode-agnostic sandbox policy configuration.

    This dataclass is the "mode-specific policy configs layered on top [of
    the shared executor]" described in architecture doc §2.3. It is
    deliberately generic: both a LazyRed-style "red-team target sandbox"
    policy and a LazyAgent-style "benchmark task sandbox" policy are
    expected to be constructed from *this same dataclass* with different
    field values -- lazycore does not encode any module-specific policy
    logic (e.g. no OWASP-mapping-aware defaults) here.

    Only the tool-calling/code-execution layer is ever governed by this
    policy (§2.3.1's split-trust model) -- there is intentionally no field
    here for GPU/Metal/MPS access, because that layer is never sandboxed.

    **Path fields must be absolute.** ``allowed_read_paths``,
    ``allowed_write_paths``, and ``working_directory`` are validated eagerly
    in ``__post_init__`` and a relative entry raises ``ValueError``
    immediately at construction time, even though this dataclass is
    ``frozen=True``. This is not an arbitrary restriction: a relative path
    would otherwise be silently re-resolved against whatever the process's
    current working directory happens to be at *``run_command()`` call
    time* (inside :func:`~lazycore.sandbox.seatbelt.build_sbpl_profile`,
    which re-derives the profile fresh on every call), which can differ
    from the directory in effect when the policy was constructed --
    especially since this executor is explicitly shared in-process across
    modules (LazyRed, LazyAgent) that may call ``os.chdir()`` for unrelated
    reasons. Requiring absolute paths up front makes a constructed
    ``SandboxPolicy``'s effective meaning actually match its ``frozen=True``
    promise: it cannot change out from under a caller later. Callers should
    pass paths from sources that are already absolute, e.g.
    ``tempfile.mkdtemp()``'s return value or ``Path(...).resolve()``.
    ``allowed_executables`` is intentionally exempt from this requirement
    (see below) since bare command names resolved via ``PATH`` are a
    documented, legitimate value for that field.

    Attributes:
        allow_network: Whether the sandboxed process may open any network
            connections at all. When ``False``, executors should apply a
            default-deny egress policy.
        allowed_read_paths: Filesystem paths (files or directories) the
            sandboxed process may read. Directories are allowed
            recursively. Paths outside this list should be unreadable to
            the sandboxed process (subject to each backend's minimum
            required system paths -- see each executor's docstring). Must
            be absolute (see above); a relative entry raises ``ValueError``
            at construction time.
        allowed_write_paths: Filesystem paths (files or directories) the
            sandboxed process may write to. Must be a subset of what's
            readable in spirit, but is tracked separately since "can read"
            and "can write" are different risk levels. Must be absolute
            (see above); a relative entry raises ``ValueError`` at
            construction time.
        allowed_executables: Absolute paths (or bare names resolved via
            ``PATH`` by the executor) of executables the sandboxed process
            is allowed to exec. An empty tuple means "no restriction is
            applied by this field" -- executors document their own default
            behavior when this is empty. Unlike the read/write path fields,
            bare (non-absolute) names are accepted here by design.
        env: Extra environment variables to set for the sandboxed process,
            on top of (or instead of, depending on ``inherit_env``) the
            calling process's environment.
        inherit_env: Whether the sandboxed process inherits the calling
            process's full environment (with ``env`` applied as overrides)
            or starts from an empty environment plus only ``env``.
        timeout_seconds: Optional wall-clock timeout applied to the
            sandboxed command. ``None`` means no timeout.
        working_directory: Optional working directory for the sandboxed
            process. If set, it should also be included in
            ``allowed_read_paths``/``allowed_write_paths`` as appropriate --
            executors do not implicitly grant it access. Must be absolute
            (see above) if set; a relative value raises ``ValueError`` at
            construction time.
