"""Cosine-similarity near-duplicate detection over embeddings.

This is a minimal stand-in for the Density-Based Semantic Deduplication
(D4) capability described in the architecture doc's Part 3 ("Module 2:
LazyClean"). The real D4 design uses spherical mini-batch k-means to bucket
embeddings into clusters, then an IVF-HNSW approximate-nearest-neighbor
index within/across clusters, specifically to *avoid* O(n^2) pairwise
cosine-similarity cost at scale.

**This module deliberately implements only the naive O(n^2) brute-force
version.** For a small batch this is a perfectly correct and simple
stand-in for the ANN index; it does not scale past a few thousand rows
before the pairwise similarity matrix becomes the bottleneck the
architecture doc calls out IVF-HNSW as solving. Replacing
:func:`cosine_similarity_matrix` (and the O(n^2) loop in
:func:`find_near_duplicates`) with a real IVF-HNSW index is tracked as
follow-up work, not implemented in this scaffold-depth pass -- see the
package README for the explicit scope boundary.

    **Naive O(n^2) implementation.** This materializes an ``(n, n)`` dense
    similarity matrix, which is the exact cost profile the architecture
    doc's IVF-HNSW approximate-nearest-neighbor index (Part 3, "Module 2:
    LazyClean") exists to avoid at scale. Acceptable and simple for the
    small batches this scaffold-depth pass targets; not a substitute for
    that index once real dataset sizes are in play.

    **Zero-vector rows are undefined, not 0.0 or 1.0.** A genuinely all-zero
    embedding row (e.g. ``hashing_bag_of_words_vectorizer`` on text with no
    regex-matching tokens at all -- empty/whitespace-only text, but also
    punctuation-only text like ``"!!!"``/``"???"`` or non-ASCII text the
    tokenizer's ``[a-z0-9]+`` regex can't match) has no defined direction. A
    zero embedding means the vectorizer extracted *no features*, not that
    the source rows are equal or that they are distinct -- two different
    zero-feature texts (``"!!!"`` and ``"???"``) are not duplicates of each
    other just because they hash to the same all-zero vector, and treating
    that as similarity 1.0 falsely flags unrelated rows as duplicates at
    every valid threshold. Silently reading it as 0.0 (the plain
    normalized-dot-product result) is equally wrong in the other direction:
    it silently misses genuinely-identical zero-feature rows (e.g. two
    empty strings) as duplicates. Both are silent guesses this vectorizer
    has no basis for. This function reports the honest answer instead:
    every entry involving at least one zero-vector row (including a
    zero-vector row against itself) is ``np.nan`` -- "not comparable" --
    rather than a guessed 0.0 or 1.0. Callers that need pairwise duplicate
    decisions should treat ``nan`` as "cannot say" and handle zero-vector
    rows as a separate category (see :func:`find_near_duplicates` and
    :attr:`DedupReport.zero_vector_row_indices`).
