"""Tests for cosine-similarity near-duplicate detection over embeddings.

Threshold choice (0.9): with the hashing bag-of-words preprocessor, two
sentences that differ only in punctuation/case tokenize to the *identical*
bag of words, so their embeddings are effectively identical (cosine
similarity ~1.0). A sentence about a completely different topic shares
almost no vocabulary, so its embedding direction is essentially unrelated
(cosine similarity well below 0.9 in practice, typically near/at 0 for a
fixed random linear projection of two disjoint feature-hash supports).
0.9 sits comfortably between those two regimes for this scaffold's fixture,
without being so close to 1.0 that ordinary token-order/whitespace noise
would produce false negatives on true near-duplicates.

    Two earlier bugs bracket the correct behavior here:

    - Originally, a zero-vector row's cosine similarity to itself or to
      another zero vector always read 0.0 (the old implementation clamped
      zero norms to 1.0 before normalizing, leaving the zero vector as the
      zero vector) -- silently missing genuinely-identical zero-feature

    - A subsequent fix over-corrected by making ANY two zero-vector rows
      read similarity 1.0 -- silently flagging unrelated zero-feature rows
      (e.g. "!!!" and "???", which share no tokens at all) as duplicates of
      each other at every valid threshold.

    Neither silent guess is right: a hashing bag-of-words vectorizer that
    extracted zero features genuinely cannot tell whether two zero-feature
    texts are "the same". The correct, honest answer is NaN -- undefined,
